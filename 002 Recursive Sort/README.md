# Recursive Sort
A sorting algorithm that requires a function to call itself.

## Factorial
n! = n * n - 1 * n - 2 * ... * 1

## Flatten
Flatten a nested array.

## Nested Addition
Add up all items in a nested array.

## Merge Sort
Split the array into halves until all items completely separated
from one another and then sort and merge them recursively along
the way.

## Quick Sort
Pick a `pivot` number from array and compare each item to it.
Seperate array into two caregories `less` and `greater`. 
Store all items less than `pivot` to `less`.
Store all items greater than `pivot` to `greater`.
Repeat the same procedure to `less` and `greater` until there's
only one item left. Merge `less`, `pivot`,
and `greater` recursively along the way.
